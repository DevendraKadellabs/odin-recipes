    <li>maggi masala</li>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>chilly powder</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pour 2 cups (470 ml) of water into a pot and turn the burner to high. Once the water bubbles, open 2 2.46-ounce (70 g) packets of Maggi and add the noodles. Stir and boil the noodles until they're tender.</li>
<li>Turn off the burner and set a colander in the sink. Pour the noodles into it so the hot water drains into the sink. Then run tap water over the noodles for about 10 seconds. Set the noodles aside while you prepare the masala.</li>
<li>Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil into a skillet and turn the burner to medium-high. Stir in 1 tablespoon (8 g) of minced garlic and 1 to 2 chopped Thai green chilies. Keep stirring them until they become fragrant.</li>
<li> Put 1 1/2 cups (75 g) of finely diced vegetables into the skillet and cook them until they soften a little. You can use a single type of vegetable or a combination of your favorites.</li>
<li>Turn off the burner and add the drained noodles to the vegetables. Add 2 tablespoons (39 g) of hot sauce along with 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of white vinegar and the 2 masala flavor packets. Stir until the noodles are combined.</li>
<li>Transfer the noodles to 2 serving dishes and scatter 1 tablespoon (6 g) of chopped spring onions over each. Serve the noodles while they're still hot for the best flavor.</li>
